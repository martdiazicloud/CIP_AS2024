Academic Year: Autumn Semester 2024

Key point: web scraping and data analysis of prices between Swiss competitors, migros, coop, lidl.
After some issues in the project that did not allow to scrap data from coop.ch webpage, the goal has been reframed in scraping data from migros.ch and lidl.ch.

Reseacrh questions:
1. Which supermarket has the most competitive prices?2. Which competitor offers more brands across distinct categories?3. How much more expensive are own brands compared to traditional brands for each competitor?

The repository contains three sub-repositories named according to the project members to store the files related to the individual work.
The individual work includes web-scraping of a specific product category into migros and lidl webpages, and a first preprocessing of the data.

The group work is based on merging the data and performing the analysis to answer the research questions.

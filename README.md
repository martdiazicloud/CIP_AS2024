This repository is dedicated to the project developed during the Data Collection, Integration, and Preprocessing course (AS2024) at HSLU.

The *CIP_Project_Schedule_DeliverablesHS24.pdf* file describes the project requirements.

The file *Group 03_ETL_process_plan.pdf* contains the project aim, methodology and output.

**Project Title**: *Web Scraping of Grocery Pricing: A Comparative Study of Pasta, Rice, and
Sauces Across Three Swiss Supermarkets*

**Group members**: Fatima Barcina, Martina Diaz, Catalina Roth

Academic Year: Autumn Semester 2024

Key point: web scraping and data analysis of prices between Swiss competitors, Migros, Coop, and Lidl.

After some issues in the project that prevented scraping data from the coop.ch webpage, the goal has been reframed to scraping data from migros.ch and lidl.ch.

**Research questions**:
1. *Which supermarket has the most competitive prices?*
2. *Which competitor offers more brands across distinct categories?*
3. *How much more expensive are own brands compared to traditional brands for each competitor?*

The repository contains three sub-repositories named after the project members to store the files related to each individual work.

The individual work includes web-scraping a specific product category into Migros and Lidl webpages and a first preprocessing of the data.

The group work is based on merging data and analyzing it to answer the research questions.
